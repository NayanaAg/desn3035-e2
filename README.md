# DESN 3035 Exercise 2

Exercise Description: Based on an existing GitHub repo, extend and modify the React website by using various third-party packages found using npm.  

Write Up:  
The lab was a bit overwhelming to me at first because we had to install and import so many things which all used their own syntax. I can imagine very easily how a project could spiral out of control if proper documentation and commenting aren't used in the content files, because making small changes in existing code can get confusing very quickly. However, one thing that helped me with understanding this project was my experience with modding games. In Stardew Valley, one of the most popular mods (Stardew Expanded) used to require 10-15 other mods to be installed just to be able to run it without crashing your Steam account. Similarly, each npm plugin uses several packages to run.  

I think this lab has taught me to be slow and patient while installing plugins for my future assignments and my portfolio. I'll make sure to read the installation guides and leave plenty of comments and notes for myself so that in the future, I can do the upkeep of the website easily and know exactly which components need updates, modifications, etc. It was a fun learning process overall!
